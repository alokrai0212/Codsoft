I’m glad to share that I’ve started my Python Programming Internship at CODSOFT.

During this internship, I’ll be working on hands-on projects like:
• To-Do List Application
• Calculator
• Password Generator

The goal is to sharpen my Python skills, improve problem-solving, and build real-world mini projects.

Excited to learn, build, and share my progress here on LinkedIn.
